Hey John!

I hope you're doing great! I wanted to follow up on our recent conversation about the project timeline and requirements.

We've got this fantastic community of professionals who get together every Tuesday at 6 PM Eastern time for weekly coaching sessions. It's a wonderful platform to exchange ideas, discuss challenges, and work together on solutions. The best part? It's absolutely free, and we're just about to hit the 500-member mark!

Given your impressive background as a software engineer with 10+ years of experience in backend development, I believe your insights would be an invaluable addition to our group. If you ever have questions or need advice on your projects, our community is here to help!

By the way, if you're into AI and related topics, you'll love some of the content on our platform! Make sure to check out our resources and keep up with the latest discussions.

Excited to see you in the community!

Cheers,
Pranav J S
